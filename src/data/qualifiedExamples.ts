export const QUALIFIED_BASIS_EXAMPLE = `Example 1: The company follows accounting policy of recognizing post-employee defined benefits (gratuity) on cash basis. The company has not actuarially determined its gratuity obligations and has not recognised the same in accordance with the principles enunciated in Accounting Standard (AS) 15 (revised) - "Employees Benefits", as specified under Section 133 of the Act which could potentially lead to material misstatement in respect of post-employee defined benefits (gratuity) obligations. In the absence of any actuarial working, its impact on the financial statements is not ascertainable.

Example 2: At Rs. XXX. Management has not stated the inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value but has stated them solely at cost, which constitutes a departure from the Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company's records indicate that, had management stated the inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value, an amount of Rs. xxx would have been required to write the inventories down to their net realizable value. Accordingly, cost of sales would have been increased by Rs. xxx, and income tax, net income and shareholders’ funds would have been reduced by Rs. xxx, Rs. xxx and Rs. xxx, respectively.`;

export const DISCLAIMER_BASIS_EXAMPLE = `Example: We were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the company's compliance with Accounting Standard (AS) 15 (revised) - "Employees Benefits", as specified under Section 133 of the Act, due to lack of actuarial valuation and supporting documentation. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the financial statements.`;
